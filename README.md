This project deals with data inputs that
are in tree-like sequences and the goal is to identify frequent
itemsets of sequential patterns that are present in the data.
A typical data input of this form consists of a several trees; a
forest, each tree representing a discrete transaction in which
each node of the tree is a record containing a tuple of key
value pairs. The algorithm proposed in this paper finds the
frequent patterns in which the items in each record appear
in relation to the appearances of other items in the same
transaction in a sequential manner.</br>
